# TODO(qingling128) Rubocop bug.
# Upgrade to newer version to see if it will be fixed.
# It's complaining about the following function.
#  def k8s_container_log_entry(log,
#                              local_resource_id = K8S_LOCAL_RESOURCE_ID)
#    {
#      log: log,
#      stream: K8S_STREAM,
#      time: K8S_TIMESTAMP,
#      LOCAL_RESOURCE_ID_KEY => local_resource_id
#    }
#  end
# But if we disable it in the code, it also complains:
#
#   test/plugin/base_test.rb:1384:11: W: Useless assignment to variable - local_resource_id.
#             local_resource_id = RANDOM_LOCAL_RESOURCE_ID),
#             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
